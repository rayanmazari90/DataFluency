# ðŸŽµ Music & Mental Health Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This interactive dashboard explores the relationship between music consumption habits and mental health metrics. It analyzes how different aspects of music engagementâ€”from listening hours to genre diversity and music creationâ€”correlate with mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.

## Key Insights

Our analysis revealed several significant patterns:

1. **Music Engagement Benefits**: Higher levels of engagement with music (both listening and creation) correlate with better mental health outcomes. Musicians reported lower mental health symptom scores across all measures.

2. **Genre Diversity Matters**: People who regularly listen to a wider variety of music genres tend to report lower levels of anxiety and depression.

3. **Optimal Listening Time**: 3-5 hours of daily music listening appears to be associated with the most positive mental health outcomes.

4. **Active vs. Passive Listening**: Active engagement with music (creating, focused listening) shows stronger associations with positive mental health than passive background listening alone.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard tracks several important metrics:

- **Engagement Score**: Combines hours of listening, music creation, and contextual factors
- **Genre Diversity Index**: Measures how varied a person's music consumption is
- **Musician Effect Ratio**: Quantifies the mental health advantage of musicians vs. non-musicians

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend:

- **For Individuals**: Aim for 3-5 hours of varied music listening daily; consider learning an instrument
- **For Health Providers**: Incorporate structured music activities in mental health programs
- **For Music Services**: Develop features that gradually expand users' genre exposure
- **For Workplaces**: Create guidelines for effective music use during work

## Dashboard Features

The interactive dashboard includes:

1. **Data Overview**: Key metrics and data integrity verification
2. **Feature Engineering**: Advanced metrics derived from raw data
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Interactive visualizations of distributions and relationships
4. **Statistical Models**: Correlation, regression, and group comparison analyses
5. **Recommendations**: Evidence-based insights and practical next steps

## Technical Implementation

This project was built using:

- **Streamlit**: For the interactive web application
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For data processing
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations
- **SciPy/StatsModels**: For statistical analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal

## Data Source

The analysis uses survey data on music listening habits and self-reported mental health metrics including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD scores.

## Future Work

Potential enhancements include:

- Longitudinal data collection to better establish causality
- Personalized recommendation algorithms based on individual response patterns
- Neural mechanism investigation through collaborations with neuroscience researchers
